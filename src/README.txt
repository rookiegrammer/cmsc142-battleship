BATTLESHIP GAME
This is a program made to simulate the battleship game with two players.
A framework for implementing players is provided inside the battleship package.
By default, a brute force computer player (first player) and a randomized computer player (second player) is set to be players.

To run a simulation between two players, compile and run "SimulationUI.java"
To run multiple simulations between two players for results, compile and run "testPlay.java"

To save the results of multiple simulations, the program will prompt the directory to save a .csv file ('bs-t-[runs].csv') which will contain the simulations in each row with the first column being the result of the battle with 1 as the win of the first player and 0 otherwise while the second column as the turns the simulation ended.
